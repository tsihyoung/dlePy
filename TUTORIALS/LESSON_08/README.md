# PWSCF: Optimize lattice parameter of Ge

## :one: Purposes
Use DFT to find/optimize lattice parameter of Ge and compare with experimental data

## :two: Hows
### :large_blue_diamond: Performing scf calculation for bulk Ge with a series of lattice parameters.

- ZZ
## :three: Final products
The following items must be delivered to `LESSON_05` folder before moving to `LESSON_06`

:heavy_check_mark: 12 folders, named `EN-XX`, where `XX=20, 25, 30,..., 70`. In each folder, there are 3 files: `input.inp`, `output,dat`, and `job`.

:heavy_check_mark: `DATA.dat`, one or two python codes for plotting, and two plots for total energy and for total running time as function of  Kinetic energy cut-off. **Use meaningful name for your files**

:heavy_check_mark: A file name `RESULTS.dat` with the following information:
- The smallest value of Kinetic energy cut-off that gives total energy converged with less than 1 meV accuracy.
- Explanation of why finding optimal Kinetic energy cut-off is needed.
